By [@eapl.me](https://eapl.me/twtxt/)

## Goals
* Make it extremely easy to self-host a twtxt Web interface on a VPS or PHP shared-server
* Offer a personal Web instance to write new twts, read your timeline, follow people and reply.
  One instance for each twtxt account/file (or perhaps multi-account in the future)
* Compatible with Gemtext, and perhaps in the future with Gemini servers. (Station alike)
